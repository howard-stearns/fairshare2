	<p>FairShare is payment program in which you set your own fees, which are then distributed to members.</p>
	<p>You can join any number of groups, which each have their own currency. The members of the group vote on:
	  <ol>
	    <li>allowing a candidate member, or ejecting an existing member</li>
	    <li>the transaction fee for the group</li>
	    <li>the amount of new money to mint and give to members as a basic daily income</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can pay people in your group directly, with the group's currency, and you will be charged the current average of the member's proposals for a transaction fee. The collected fee is taken out of circulation. Most groups will want to vote to make the fees offset the daily stipend.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can pay people in other groups, too.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is a video and a very brief whitepaper at <a href="https://fairshare.social" target="fairshare">fairshare.social</a>.
